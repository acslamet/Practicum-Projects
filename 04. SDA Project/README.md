# Telecom Project

Here the commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. We are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. Here we have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. We will analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
