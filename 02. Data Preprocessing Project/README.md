# Project

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Here we already have some data on customers’ credit worthiness. 


## Goal

- To find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan.

## Business Value

- This report will be considered when building the **credit score** of a potential customer. The **credit score** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Tools

Python- Pandas and Numpy
