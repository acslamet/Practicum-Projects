In this project, you'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You'll look at real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.



Make sure there are read.me's for each project and that they are of the same structure and cover the main points: 

1. what the project is about/what is the problem 

2. what is the business value 

3. what tools and concepts you resort to.
