<b> Music Project</b>

In this project, you'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You'll look at real Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.

Hypotheses
* User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
* On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
* Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.


Make sure there are read.me's for each project and that they are of the same structure and cover the main points: 

1. what the project is about/what is the problem 

2. what is the business value 

3. what tools and concepts you resort to.
